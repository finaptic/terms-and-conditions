## Finaptic Account Agreement

This Agreement sets out the conditions that apply to your Finaptic Account and any card or other device or technology issued that allows access to the Account at any time. The fee guide is an integral part of this Agreement. Other agreements may also apply to services provided with your Account(s).

If there is a conflict between the terms of this Agreement and any other agreements, the most current version of this document will apply.

Not all features described in this Agreement may be available when you open a Finaptic Account.

The Finaptic Account and associated card is issued by NATSOLUTION and distributed by Finaptic Technologies Inc.

### How to use your Finaptic Account

The Finaptic Account is only accessible electronically, meaning you must have a compatible device that allows you to download the Finaptic App and access your Account.

The Finaptic Account allows you to:

- make a purchase everywhere Mastercard® is accepted;
- make a cash withdrawal at an ATM (Automated Teller Machine) where Mastercard® and Cirrus® are accepted;
- make a cash withdrawal from a merchant, if accepted by the merchant;
- transfer money through Interac e-Transfers®;
- make electronic funds transfers such as preauthorized debits;
- make online bill payments through the mobile application.

Money in your account does not earn interest. You must load money to your account before using your card to make transactions.

**a. Mobile access**

You can access your Account and carry out transactions through the Finaptic App. NATSOLUTION does not provide the services on the Finaptic mobile application and is not responsible for them, or any loss, harm or damage of any kind you may suffer as a result of using the Finaptic App and associated services.

**b. Card access**

You may access your Account through a card we issue to you to make payments from your account everywhere Mastercard is accepted. Cards on this Account will operate on the Mastercard network. This means, when making purchases, you should select “Credit” at the point of sale to complete the transaction.

*Request a Card* - We may not automatically send you a card to access your account. If you don’t automatically receive one, you can request a physical or virtual card for yourself or an authorized user at any time. Instructions on how to do this are provided on the mobile app.

*Expiry date of the card* - Your card has an expiry date. The expiry date is indicated on your card. We will replace your physical card when it expires. Your virtual card will be automatically renewed. We may not replace your card. For example, we will not replace it if you haven’t used it for an extended period of time. You cannot make transactions with an expired card.

*Accessing Accounts* - Each card may be used to access more than one account. This means that the same card can be linked to your accounts as well as accounts for which you are an authorized user.

*Cards are subject to daily and weekly transaction limits.*

The transaction limit varies depending whether the transaction is carried out:

- at an ATM, including for a withdrawal of cash;
- with a participating merchant;
- for fund transfers between accounts.

**c. Use of your account**

Your account must be used for personal purposes, in compliance with legislation and in a reasonable fashion, as must the technological devices used to access it.

**d. Service charges**

Service charges are described in the fee guide. We periodically revise these charges and will disclose them to you electronically. Every month, we debit these charges from your account.

These charges are debited on the first business day after the day on which the billing cycle assigned to you ends. The charge debit date and the date charges appear on your statement or in your passbook do not always correspond. If the end of the billing cycle falls on a non-business day, fees are indicated on the previous business day even if they are debited later.

You must pay these charges as well as those set out in our fee guide to process information or document requests regarding you from third parties, for example, under the terms of a writ of seizure, notice of appearance, decree, a request from a government agency or any other request that we must legally process.

Third parties may also charge additional fees, for example, enrolment fees for a technological device, connection fees for using our online services or fund transfer fees. You are responsible for paying these fees.

**e. How to load money to your account**

You can load money to your account through: Interac e-transfer® Electronic funds transfers such as direct deposits

You are responsible to check your account payment history to know the status of a transfer.

**f. Stop a payment**

You can request a stop a payment to prevent a preauthorized debit. You must contact customer services as indicated on the line Information about your Finaptic Account above within a reasonable amount of time before the payment. You must inform us of the date of the payment, its amount, the account number and the payee’s name. If any of this information is inaccurate, the stop payment will not be carried out. We are not responsible for any inconvenience you may experience in such an event. Despite a stop payment order, a preauthorized debit can be presented again for a future payment date. You are responsible for contacting the person to whom you gave authorization to cancel any future preauthorized debits. We will not follow up with that person on your behalf.
