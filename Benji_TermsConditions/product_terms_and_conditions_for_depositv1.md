### How to use your Benji Pocket Account

The Benji Pocket Account is only accessible electronically, meaning you must have a compatible device that allows you to download the Benji App and access your Account.

The Benji Pocket Account allows you to transfer funds between your accounts. Money in your account does not earn interest.

#### a. Mobile access

You can access your Account and carry out transactions through the Benji App. NATSOLUTION does not provide the services on the Benji mobile application and is not responsible for them, or any loss, harm or damage of any kind you may suffer as a result of using the Benji App and associated services.

The charge debit date and the date charges appear on your statement do not always correspond. If the end of the billing cycle falls on a non-business day, fees are indicated on the previous business day even if they are debited later.

You must pay these charges as well as those set out in our fee guide to process information or document requests regarding you from third parties, for example, under the terms of a writ of seizure, notice of appearance, decree, a request from a government agency or any other request that we must legally process.
