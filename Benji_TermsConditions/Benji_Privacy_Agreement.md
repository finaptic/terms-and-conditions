The Privacy Policy below describes how we collect and use personal information, and the circumstances under which we may share this information. 

This Privacy Policy applies to the privacy practices of Benji on its website, located at http://www.betterwithbenji.com (the “Benji Website”), to the Benji Tax offering on the Website (“Benji Tax”), and to Benji-branded applications, including the Benji mobile application (the “Benji App”, and together with Benji Tax and the Website, the “Platform”).

##### Collection and Use of Information

We collect and use information differently depending on what parts of our Platform you use. We have described the purposes for collection and use of information according to the Platform generally, and more specifically for the Benji App, Benji Tax, and the Website below.

##### The Platform

When you use any of the Benji App, Benji Tax, or the Website, we may collect and use information as follows: 

- **Social Media**: We may offer you the opportunity to engage with Benji or its content on or through third-party social media websites, plug-ins and applications. When you engage with us on or through third-party social media websites, plug-ins and applications, you may allow us to have access to certain information associated with your social media account (e.g. name, username, email address, profile picture) to deliver content or as part of the operation of the website, plug-in or application.

- **Marketing Communications**: You may select if you wish to receive email marketing communications with updates and other information regarding Benji by providing us with your email. You can opt out of receiving marketing emails from us using the opt-out or “unsubscribe” instructions provided in the communication. Alternatively, you may contact our Privacy Officer at privacy@betterwithbenji.com. Please note that you may continue to receive certain transactional or account-related communications from us.

- **Surveys and Research**: From time to time, we may offer you the opportunity to participate in one of our surveys or other research projects. The information obtained through our surveys and customer research is used in an aggregated, non-personally identifiable form to help us understand our customers and to enhance our product and service offerings.

- **Contact Us**: When you contact us with a comment or question, we collect the information you provide such as your email address, along with additional information that we may need to help us promptly respond to your inquiry. We retain this information to assist you in the future and to improve our customer service and service offerings. We also use personal information to establish and manage our relationship with you and provide quality service.

##### Benji App

When you use the Benji App, we may collect and use information as follows: 

- **Account Registration**: When you register for an account, we collect information including your name, home address, birth date, telephone number, email address, business set up, business name, business address, business telephone number, occupation, industry of operations, source of funds, intended account use, tax disclaimers, and third-party declaration to open a business operating account, and to allow us to satisfy Know Your Client and anti-money laundering obligations under applicable laws. You also provide us with your name, email address, and a password that you select which we use to create and administer your account and use of the Benji App. 

- **Using Benji**: When you register for a business operating account using the Benji App, you are registering for an account exclusively for use in connection with your self-employed work. We maintain information about your work business operating account including transactional history (merchant name, time of purchase, location of purchase) and account balances to enable the business operating account service of the Benji App.

- **Push Notifications**: If you provide your consent to receive push notifications, we may display push notifications on your mobile device such as welcome messages, product features and promotional offers. If you wish to stop receiving push notifications from us, you can turn off push notifications for the App in the settings of your mobile device.

- **App Usage Information & Analytics**: As with many applications, certain limited data is required for the Benji App to function on your device. This data includes the type of device hardware and operating system, unique device identiﬁer, IP address, language settings, and the date and time the Benji App accesses our servers. We use this information to help us understand the activity on the Benji App, to monitor and improve the Benji App, and to tailor your in-Benji-App experience. In addition, we may use third party service providers to collect analytical information about your use of the Benji App, such as the Benji App features used and time spent on the Benji App, to help us tailor your in-app experience, improve our products and the quality of our Benji App, and to manage and analyze data in order to better understand our users.

- **Additional Information**: We will use commercially reasonable efforts, given the limitations imposed upon us by third party providers such as Apple Inc. and Google Inc., to clearly disclose what, if any information is collected by the Benji App, how it is used, and with whom it is shared. Please note, certain practices are outside of our control, for example, tracking by Apple, Inc., Google, Inc., or your third-party telecommunications carrier. We are not responsible for the actions of such third parties. You should always read and understand the policies of any third-party provider, such as Apple with respect to iOS apps and Google with respect to Android apps, and your wireless carrier, before making any purchase or downloading any app.

##### Benji Tax

When you use the Benji Tax, we may collect and use information as follows: 

- **Account Registration**: When you register for an account, we collect information including your province of residence, a description of your self-employed work, whether that work is full time, how long you have been doing that work, the approximate amount of time you spend working on your phone, the approximate amount of your home that you use for that work, whether you discuss that work over meals, whether you travel for work, and how often you file your GST/HST return. We use this information to identify potential tax write-offs based on your responses. You also provide us with your name, email address, and a password that you select, which we use to administer access to your account.

- **Connecting Bank Accounts**: To enable Benji Tax to scan your bank accounts for potential tax write-offs, you have to connect your bank account to your Benji Tax account.

Benji does receive through Plaid your bank account information, transactional history, and account balances for up to the last 2 years. We use this information to identify potential tax-write-offs in your transactional history based on your account registration responses. 

- **Using Benji Tax**: When you use Benji Tax, you may categorize transactions in your imported transaction history as being either personal or related to your self-employed work. We use this information to classify your transactions for tax write-off purposes, and to help generate your tax report.
